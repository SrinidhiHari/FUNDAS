/*How to find if a table has duplicates*/

Step 1:

Select count(*) from table

Step 2:

select count(*) from (select distinct * from table)

If the record count in returned by Query in Step  and Step 2 are equal then the table does nto have duplicates


/*How to find duplicates of a column*/

select column_name, count(*) from  table group by column_name having count(*) > 

Get the values for this column and query the table to check the duplicates
/*How to search for a column in a database*/

SQL Server: INFORMATION_SCHEMA
Oracle: all_tab_cols

/*How to find which column in the table has duplicates*/

/*How to generate a sequence of numbers in SQL query*/

SQL- Structured query language- used to interact with database Management systems.

RDMBS- relational database management system- Oracle, SQL Server

DML- Data Manipulation language- syntax which changes the value of table-> Insert, Update, delete
DDL- Data definaition Language- Syntax which changes the table-> CREATE, ALTER, TRUNCATE
DCL- Data Control Language- Suntax which controls the data in terms of viewing, modifying-> Grant, revoke
TCL- Transaction Control Languagae- Syntax which controls a transaction-> Commit, roll back

/*which one to use : Truncate or Delete*/

If the need is to remove all the records from the table, Truncate can be used, It is a DDL statement and behaves faster than Delete.
If the need is to remove selected records from the table, delete can be used.
